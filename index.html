<div class="about">
         <p>I am a front-end web developer who has a soft spot for design. I studied law for four years where I acquired some very applicale skills including having an eye for detail. I always have a negative perception towards people who are rude hence why I practice actively everyday to accept and welcome all people which in turn has given me awesome and fun experiences working in groups. I have an abnormal obsession with watching car engines being built and I also believe that I was Denzel Washington in another life. </p>
