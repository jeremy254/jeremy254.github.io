<div class="about">
         <p>I am a front-end web developer who has a soft spot for design. I have been a student studying law for four years where I acquired some very applicale skills including having an eye for detail. I began my front web journey 6 months ago and im improving by the day and  acquiring experience. </p>
         <p>I decided to join Moringa school in order to find a sense of community and also have access to a consistent stream of information as opposed to using multiple sources that lead to confusion. I also wanted to affrim myself that I would meet the industry standard at best with the code I was going to offer</p>
         <p>As any person would, I also indulge in some hobbies and interests when im not working. Those hobbies are watching a disturbing amount of tech and car videos online. I also enjoy eating out and being functional with my hands building and repairing things.</p>
